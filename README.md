# Oofers-Music-Bot
A python music discord bot with queue

What I have added:
  - !play (link) - Plays the song or queues the song.
  - !skip - Skips current song.
  - !stop - Stops the bot.
  - !pause - Pauses the song.
  - !resume - Resumes the song.
  - !dc - Disconnects the bot.
  - !clear - Clears the last 5 messages.

What I'm planning to add:
  - Search function to the !play command

The differnet files I have:
  - main.py - This is the live version of the bot
  - main-DEV.py - This is the develepment version that I am working on. This is used on the second bot
  - keep_alive.py - This is a script that I use on replit.com to keep the bot live.
  - Version-1.py - This is my first ever version of the bot. Just to see how it started :)
